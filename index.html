    <h2>Famous Jokes</h2>
    <p>According to most studies, people’s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? </p>
    <p><em>This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you’re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy</em></p>
    
    <p>A friend of mine is going in for a nose job next week. Guy. You know what the technical term for a nose job is?</p>
    <p><em>Rhinoplasty! Rhino! This guy is aware he has a bit of a problem … he’s obviously sensitive about it, that’s why he made the appointment. Do we really need to compare him to a goddamn rhinoceros?</em></p>
    
    <p>Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you’ve got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem</p>
    <p><em>Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash</em></p>
    
    <p>Why did the coffee file a police report?I was best man at a wedding one time and that was pretty good. Pretty good title, I thought … ‘Best man.’ I thought it was a bit much. I thought we had the groom and the ‘pretty good man.’ That’s more than enough.</p>
    <p><em>That’s more than enough. If I am the best man, why is she marrying him?</em></p>

  <p>I recently encountered some errors in my HTML code that were related to obsolete attributes in my table element. Specifically, I was using the "cellpadding", "cellspacing", and "border" attributes, which are no longer recommended. To fix these errors, I could switch to CSS instead of these attributes.</p>
  <p>To use CSS instead, I could define a class or ID for the table element and use CSS to set the desired padding, spacing, and border properties for that class or ID. For example, I could create a class called "my-table" and set the padding to 10 pixels, the spacing to 5 pixels, and the border to 1 pixel.

    After defining the class, I could apply it to the table element by adding the "class" attribute to the table element and setting it to "my-table". This way, the table would be styled according to the CSS rules I had defined for the "my-table" class.
        
    Switching to CSS instead of the obsolete attributes is important because it follows modern web development practices and ensures that my code is accessible and readable by all devices and browsers. Additionally, separating the styles from the HTML code makes it easier to update the styles without having to modify the HTML.</p>
