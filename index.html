    <h2>Famous Jokes</h2>
    <p>According to most studies, people’s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? </p>
    <p><em>This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you’re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy</em></p>
    
    <p>A friend of mine is going in for a nose job next week. Guy. You know what the technical term for a nose job is?</p>
    <p><em>Rhinoplasty! Rhino! This guy is aware he has a bit of a problem … he’s obviously sensitive about it, that’s why he made the appointment. Do we really need to compare him to a goddamn rhinoceros?</em></p>
    
    <p>Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you’ve got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem</p>
    <p><em>Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash</em></p>
    
    <p>Why did the coffee file a police report?I was best man at a wedding one time and that was pretty good. Pretty good title, I thought … ‘Best man.’ I thought it was a bit much. I thought we had the groom and the ‘pretty good man.’ That’s more than enough.</p>
    <p><em>That’s more than enough. If I am the best man, why is she marrying him?</em></p>
